# Exploratory-data-Analysis-
week2 assignment for Data Management and Visualization

my dataset is Adolescent Health.
I am using python. I included python script in another file.

A random sample of 6,504 adolescents were asked the following question, “ Do your parents let you make your own decisions about the time you must be home on weekend nights?” Of the total number, about 65.55 % chose category 0 (no), and about 32.11% fell into category 1 (yes). 

For the next question, the same students were asked “Do your parents let you make your own decisions about the people you hang around with?" About 83.33 chose category 1 (yes), about 14.48% fell into category 0 (no).

For the next question, "On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is low and 5 is high, how disappointed would she be if you did not graduate from high school?” About 82.21 percent of students fell into category 5(the highest). 

For this question, I subgrouped it by race. for white, 83.03 percent of students fell into category 5. for black, 81.13 percent. for American Indian or Native American, 73.97 percent. for Asian or Pacific Islander, 78.38 percent. for Other, 81.48 percent.
